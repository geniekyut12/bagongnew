    <string name="fooddisc">Eating plant-based meals instead of meat significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions, conserves water, and lowers energy use associated with food production.

    <string name="co2">-10 kg CO2</string>
    <string name="day2texts">Many electronics continue to consume energy even when turned off, a phenomenon known as \"phantom\" or \"standby\" power. By unplugging devices such as chargers, appliances, and entertainment systems when they’re not in use, you can significantly cut down on unnecessary energy consumption, lower your carbon footprint, and save on electricity bills. This simple habit can make a big difference in reducing overall energy waste.\n\nThis challenge helps build sustainable habits while contributing to energy conservation and reducing unnecessary environmental impact.</string>
    <string name="day3texts">Single-use plastic water bottles contribute significantly to pollution and landfill waste, taking hundreds of years to decompose. By switching to a reusable water bottle, you reduce plastic waste, minimize your carbon footprint, and help conserve resources. It’s an easy and effective way to stay hydrated while supporting a more sustainable lifestyle.\n\nThis challenge not only reduces plastic waste but also encourages healthier hydration habits.</string>
    <string name="day4texts">Instead of buying takeout or extra groceries, this challenge encourages you to get creative with what’s already in your pantry, fridge, or freezer. Not only does this reduce food waste and save money, but it also promotes resourcefulness and helps you discover new ways to combine ingredients. By using what you have on hand, you can create delicious, budget-friendly meals while minimizing your environmental footprint.\n\nThis challenge helps you minimize food waste, save money, and make the most of what’s already in your kitchen.</string>
    <string name="day5texts">Over time, old emails and files accumulate, taking up unnecessary space on your devices and cloud storage. By organizing and deleting outdated or unused files, you can improve device performance, make it easier to find important information, and reduce your digital footprint. This challenge encourages digital decluttering, helping you stay organized while contributing to more efficient use of storage resources.\n\nThis challenge helps you maintain a cleaner, more organized digital environment while improving device efficiency and security.</string>

    <string name="instruction">Instructions:</string>
    <string name="youwillneed">You will need</string>
    <string name="barrierinstruction">• The model you made in melting ice experiment, refilled with water.\n• Empty water bottle.\n• A pack of toothpicks or fallen branches, flower stems or plants.</string>
    <string name="procedure">Procedure:</string>
    <string name="barrierstep">1. Study your current model. What do you think can be done to prevent the waves from reaching the houses?\n2. Try making a barrier by sticking toothpicks up in the clay along the waterline.\n3. Roll the bottle to make waves. How successful is your barrier? What else do you think you could do to keep water from reaching the houses and buildings? Try it on your model. Compare your methods and results with each of your classmates</string>
    <string name="barrierbelow">In this chapter, you will get to learn about the impacts of climate change and think or more methods of adapting to it.</string>

    <string name="envinstruct">"List down the most common climate hazards where you live. Which is your community most at risk of in the rainy season? In the dry season?\n\nList down the common ways that help you adapt to these top climate hazards. Assess whether any of you answers are forms of maladaptation. Come up with better alternatives for the maladaptations. "</string>

    <string name="expinstruct">○ Two thermometers\n○ A clear glass jar/bottle big enough to hold one of the thermometers.</string>
    <string name="dothisin">DO THIS IN SUNNY DAY.</string>
    <string name="expprocedure">1. Turn both thermometers on and put one inside the jar. Cover it.\n2. Lay the jar in direct sunlight on its side, with the other thermometer beside it, but not touching it. Make sure that the sun is shining directly on both thermometers.\n3. Check temperature after two minutes. Which one has the higher temperature? How many degrees is the difference?</string>
    <string name="expbelow">This simple experiment will show how Arrhenius’ observation led him to make the connection between carbon dioxide and the warming of the Earth.</string>
    <string name="iceinstruc">• 2 bars of modeling clay\n• Small objects like rocks or bottle caps to simulate structures\n• A rectangular container measuring approximately 8 x 13 inches\n• A tightly sealed drinking bottle shorter than the container’s width\n• 6 ice cubes</string>
    <string name="iceproc">1. Shape the modeling clay into two flat-topped land masses.\n2. Position the clay at opposite ends of the container. Fill the container with water until the clay is submerged halfway.\n3. Press small objects into one clay mass to represent houses and buildings, ensuring they are placed in various areas above the waterline.\n4. Use the plastic bottle to create waves by bouncing or rolling it toward the clay.\n5. Place ice cubes on the clay at the opposite end to represent glaciers. Leave the setup in a warm area and observe any changes over time.\n6. Once observations are complete, pour out the water and store the setup for future use if desired.</string>
    <string name="icebelow">You can see from this activity how melting ice from the cryosphere leads to rise in sea levels.</string>
    <string name="jarinstr">○ Two identical glass jars or bottles\n○ Ceramic Saucers\n○ Boiling Water\n○ 6 Ice Cubes</string>
    <string name="jarproc">1. Fill about 1/2 of one jar with room temperature water and the other with the same amount of boiling water.\n2. Place a saucer on the top of each jar.\n3. After three minutes, put three ice cubes in each saucer.</string>
    <string name="whathappen">What happened inside each jar?</string>
    <string name="whathappens">In the experiment, water quickly evaporates and condenses in the jar with hot water. In the same way, greater heat causes more water from the surface of the Earth to evaporate, condense, then turn into rain.</string>
    <string name="jarbeloww">"This experiment will show how an increase in temperature make a difference in the amount of rainfall. "</string>
    <string name="spereinstruc">"○ A container for your terrarium (you may repurpose a large clear wide-mouthed glass jar or plastic bottle)\n○ A small plants like pansit-pansitan, ferns, wood sorrel, oxalis, or golden pothos\n○ Small spade or any tool for digging. "</string>
    <string name="sphereproced">1. At the bottom of the jar, dampen the soil and idg enough space for you plans, covering their roots with soil. Make sure they do not touch the sides of your terrarium.\n2. Close and seal the terrarium again then it by a sunny window.\n3. Observe your plant. Are they able to survive without being watered.</string>
